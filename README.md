# Customer-Attrition
Customer attrition, aka customer churn or customer turnover.
Customer churn is one of the main problems in the telecommunications industry. The word “CHURN” means to stop consuming products of a specific company and use substitutable product of another company because it is of much better quality or service or less price. Several studies have shown that attracting new customers is much more expensive than retaining existing ones. Most financial institutions are concerned with customer retention to prevent losing of their market share and maximise their gained profit from existing customers. Therefore, companies are focusing on developing accurate and reliable predictive models to identify potential customers that will churn soon.
The objective of classification of most of the churn prediction studies is to minimize the prediction error and maximize the accuracy and developing a profit-based algorithm which classifies churners and non-churners such that it focuses on profit of the industry by giving more weight to detection of profitable customers.
